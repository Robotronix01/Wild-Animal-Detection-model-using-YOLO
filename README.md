# Project Title - Wild Animal Detection In Night Vision

# Description
This project is an attempt to develop Wild Animal Detection (night vision) using modern computer vision technology.It involved the inclusion of Yolov5.

# Pre-requisites
●	Python
●	Basics of Deep Learning
●	Computer Vision
●	Yolov5

# Dependencies 
●	Python
●	Yolov5
●	Pytorch
●	Roboflow
●	OpenCv
●	Numpy
●	Pandas
●	Seaborn
●	Matplotlib

●	Cuda

# Folders
1.	Create a folder which contains all the images with their annotated file. This folder we have to upload on roboflow while creating the dataset.
2.	Create an account on roboflow then create a dataset on which we will upload the above mentioned folder.
